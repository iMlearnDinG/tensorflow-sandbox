Welcome to my TensorFlow sandbox.

Fuel Price
- Data from 2020 - 2022 for QLD fuel prices has been scrubbed.
- Scripts to run predictions for future prices included.


Card Game
- I have generated results of a card game to train an AI model.
- I have also run a batch_training session to determine which ML archetecture will produce the best model.
- Gameplay including trained model included.

I will be including a more indepth analysis at a later date as part of my attempt to create a decent portfolio, unfortunately I have CoViD at the moment.
